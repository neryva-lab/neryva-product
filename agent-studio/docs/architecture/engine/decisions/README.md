# Engine Decisions

Index of Architecture Decision Records for the Engine control plane.

Each decision records a non-weakening invariant or a divergence from the proposed implementation
baseline (`engine_architecture.md`).

## Process

- One ADR per invariant or divergence.
- Status: `proposed` → `accepted` → `superseded`.
- Reference in PR description and in `docs/architecture/engine/imp/ledger.md` task.

## Expected ADRs (from `imp/ledger.md:0.1`)

| ADR-002 | Tenant model + RLS `ENABLE + FORCE` with `app.current_tenant` transaction-local                      | `engine_architecture.md:263`       |
| ADR-003 | Public REST/OpenAPI contract, versioning, pagination, idempotency, `Last-Event-ID`                   | `engine_architecture.md:322`       |
| ADR-004 | Neryva MCP authority integration (capability, lease fencing, `ArtifactRef`)                          | `engine_architecture.md:357`       |
| ADR-005 | Outbox/inbox + transport (PostgreSQL polling → NATS JetStream when measured)                         | `engine_architecture.md:373`       |
| ADR-006 | PostgreSQL migration policy — ordered, reviewed, immutable, single release job, expand/contract      | `engine_data_and_lifecycle.md:406` |
| ADR-007 | Object-store upload + claim-check `ArtifactRef` with 7 facade checks                                 | `engine_architecture.md:296`       |

| ADR-010 | Retention / deletion / legal-hold / recovery (WORM, purge order)                                     | `engine_data_and_lifecycle.md:359` |
| ADR-011 | Divergence: `drizzle-orm` retained as SQL-visible builder (vs spec `Kysely + pg`)                    | `imp/ledger.md:3.5`                |
| ADR-012 | Divergence: `NestJS + FastifyAdapter` retained (vs spec `Fastify` alone) — explicit schemas required | `imp/ledger.md:3.5`                |
